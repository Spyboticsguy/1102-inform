Understand "get out of [anything]" as a mistake ("Just GET OUT without saying what you want to exit.").
Understand "exit [anything]" as a mistake ("Just EXIT without saying what you want to exit.").

Understand "go upstairs" as a mistake ("Try going UP instead.").

Before wearing something:
	if the player is in the bed, say "You should get out of bed before getting dressed." instead.

Section 3 - Values

[Well, in a manner of speaking, it is.]

A road is a kind of room.

Instead of exiting in a road:

Clothing is a kind of thing. Clothing is usually wearable.

Section 4 - New Actions

[Just really doesn't matter what we say.]

Resting is an action applying to nothing.

		end the story saying "That was a chaotic morning. Was this really the only memory you had of your wife? Perhaps you should try again.";

I'm afraid she's been in a terrible accident and is in critical condition.'[paragraph break]Your breathing gets shallow. Blotches begin to appear in your eyes. You dash out the door, get into your car, and drive to the hospital. Your memory of the event is a blur - you can't even remember if you told your boss where you were going.";
			now the player is in the hospital;
	otherwise:
		say "Some smooth jazz starts to play."

Section 1 - Back on the Highway

The Exit is a road in the End. "This exit will take you to work the back way around.

Section 3 - Inside the Office

The Office is a room in the end. "Your office is unusually roomy. On your desk sits a small picture of your family, as well as a small area free of dust, in the shape of your phone.[line break]You have a few minutes to kill before your first meeting of the day. Maybe you should apologize to your wife? If something happened to her, you don't want your last words to eachother to be hateful!"

The picture is a thing inside the office.
The description of the picture is "A lovely family photo of your wife and children. Taken last month, in fact. On the back is scribbled: 'To my favorite dad!'"

After waiting while the player is in the hospital:
	say "The doctor exits the room, not quite meeting your eyes. He motions for you to go inside, then goes off to parts unknown.[paragraph break]You enter.";
	now the value corresponding to a consequence of "loops" in the Table of Memory is 3;
	now the value corresponding to a consequence of "completed" in the Table of Memory is 1;
	end the story saying "You apologized to your wife. She died in ICU hours later. You reconciled with her, but there was nothing the doctors could do. She had sustained traumatic injuries around her stomach, and any kind of intensive surgery risked rupturing the intestines and spreading contagion throughout the body. She died peacefully, though, in medicine-induced sleep.[paragraph break]Don't come back."
